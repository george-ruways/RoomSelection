### Step 1: Set Up Google Sheets Backend

1. **Create Google Apps Script Project:**
   - Go to [script.google.com](https://script.google.com)
   - Click "New Project"
   - Replace the default code with `google-apps-script-rebuild.js`
   - Save the project with a meaningful name (e.g., "Room Selection Backend")

2. **Deploy as Web App:**
   - Click "Deploy" ‚Üí "New deployment"
   - Type: Web app
   - Description: "Room Selection API"
   - Execute as: Me
   - Who has access: Anyone
   - Click "Deploy"
   - **Copy the Web App URL** (you'll need this for the frontend)

3. **Initialize the Spreadsheet:**
   - In the Apps Script editor, run the `initializeScript()` function
   - This creates the required sheets: RoomSelections, Settings, AvailableNames
   - Check that a new Google Spreadsheet was created with these sheets

### Step 2: Configure Frontend

1. **Update Configuration:**
   - Open `main-rebuild.js`
   - Replace `YOUR_SCRIPT_ID` in `GOOGLE_SHEETS_URL` with your actual Web App URL
   - Example: `https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbz.../exec`

2. **Replace Files:**
   ```bash
   # In your RoomSelection directory
   cp index-rebuild.html index.html
   cp styles-rebuild.css styles.css
   cp main-rebuild.js main.js
   ```

### Step 3: Deploy Frontend

1. **Web Server Deployment:**
   - Upload `index.html`, `styles.css`, and `main.js` to your web hosting
   - Ensure all files are in the same directory
   - Test the deployment URL

2. **Local Testing:**
   ```bash
   # For testing locally
   python -m http.server 8000
   # Visit http://localhost:8000
   ```
